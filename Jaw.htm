<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>A jaw
crusher uses compressive force for breaking of particle. This mechanical
pressure is achieved by the two jaws of the crusher of which one is fixed while
the other reciprocates. A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical
jaws, one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw
called a swing jaw, moves back and forth relative to it, by a cam or pitman
mechanism, acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker. The volume or cavity
between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber. The movement of the swing
jaw can be quite small, since complete crushing is not performed in one stroke.
The inertia required to crush the material is provided by a weighted flywheel
that moves a shaft creating an eccentric motion that causes the closing of the
gap.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Jaw
crushers are heavy duty machines and hence need to be robustly constructed. The
outer frame is generally made of cast iron or steel. The jaws themselves are
usually constructed from cast steel. They are fitted with replaceable liners
which are made of manganese steel, or Ni-hard (a Ni-Cr alloyed cast iron). Jaw
crushers are usually constructed in sections to ease the process transportation
if they are to be taken underground for carrying out the operations.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>The
Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858. The Blake type jaw
crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area. Blake crushers are
of two types- single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>In the
single toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft
which leads to a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw
crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of
motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and
vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when
combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists
in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to
higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher
wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the
crushing of softer particles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>In the
double toggle jaw crushers, the oscillating motion of the swing jaw is caused
by the vertical motion of the pitman. The pitman moves up and down. The swing
jaw closes, i.e., it moves towards the fixed jaw when the pitman moves upward
and opens during the downward motion of the pitman. This type is commonly used
in mines due to its ability to crush tough and abrasive materials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>In the
Dodge type jaw crushers, the jaws are farther apart at the top than at the
bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the material is crushed progressively
smaller and smaller as it travels downward until it is small enough to escape
from the bottom opening. The Dodge jaw crusher has a variable feed area and a
fixed discharge area which leads to choking of the crusher and hence is used
only for laboratory purposes and not for heavy duty operations.</span></p>
