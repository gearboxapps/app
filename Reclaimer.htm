<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.5pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:black'>A reclaimer is a large machine used in bulk material handling
applications. A reclaimer's function is to recover bulk material such as ores
and cereals from a stockpile. A stacker is used to stack the material.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.5pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:black'>Reclaimers are volumetric machines and are rated in m3/h (cubic
meters per hour) for capacity, which is often converted to t/h (tonnes per
hour) based on the average bulk density of the material being reclaimed.
Reclaimers normally travel on a rail between stockpiles in the stockyard. A
bucket wheel reclaimer can typically move in three directions: horizontally
along the rail; vertically by &quot;luffing&quot; its boom and rotationally by
slewing its boom. Reclaimers are generally electrically powered by means of a
trailing cable.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.5pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:black'>Reclaimer types</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.5pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:black'>Bucket wheel reclaimers use &quot;bucket wheels&quot; for removing
material from the pile they are reclaiming. Scraper reclaimers use a series of
scrapers on a chain to reclaim the material.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.5pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:black'>The reclaimer structure can be of a number of types, including
portal and bridge. Reclaimers are named according to this type, such as
&quot;Bridge reclaimer&quot;. Portal and bridge reclaimers can both use either
bucket wheels or scrapers to reclaim the product. Bridge type reclaimers blend
the stacked product as it is reclaimed..</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.5pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:black'>Control systems</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.5pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:black'>Stackers and Reclaimers were originally manually controlled manned
machines with no remote control. Modern machines are typically fully automated
with their parameters (for stacking or reclaiming) remotely set. Some older
reclaimers may still be manually controlled, as reclaiming is more difficult to
automate than stacking because the automatic detection of pile edges is
complicated by different environmental conditions and different bulk materials.</span></p>
